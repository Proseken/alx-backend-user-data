# 0x02. Session authentication

Session authentication is a mechanism used in computer security and web applications to verify the identity of users and control their access to resources. It involves the creation and management of sessions for individual users during their interactions with a system or application. Sessions provide a way to maintain user state and track their activities across multiple requests without requiring them to repeatedly provide their credentials (e.g., username and password) for each action.

Cookies play a critical role in implementing session authentication. Cookies are used to carry the session ID between the user's browser and the server, facilitating the session authentication process. They help maintain the connection between the user and their session data, ensuring seamless interactions and personalized experiences in web applications.

However, session authentication also requires careful security considerations to prevent issues like session hijacking, where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session. Techniques such as secure session handling, encryption, and expiring sessions are essential to ensuring the safety of user data and interactions.
