# 0x01. Basic authentication

Basic Authentication (BasicAuth) is a simple authentication mechanism used in HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for securing web resources. It's one of the most straightforward methods of authentication, but it's also relatively less secure compared to more modern authentication methods like OAuth or token-based authentication.

Given its limitations, modern web applications often prefer more secure authentication methods, such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, token-based authentication, or session-based authentication combined with secure transmission protocols like HTTPS. These methods provide better security, more advanced features, and improved user experiences.
